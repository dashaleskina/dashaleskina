This is an implementation of the Japanese crossword puzzle game. The game has three difficulty levels, when you click on a cell, the timer starts and stops on successful completion. All actions are accompanied by beeps that can be turned off. Different screen widths are supported, and the menu for different screens is also different. There are many other functions as well. By the way, the design was completely developed by me.
